## Dmitri - Element Manager CLI for Cloud Elements

### Summary

Dmitri was intended to make working with examining and testing elements easier. It was built for use by the Delivery team but has many applications for tasks like:
- discover particlular properties of an element 
- see a summary of available resources
- compare elements across environments (e.g. staging, snapshot)  or user accounts

### Installation

If you don't have `node` and `npm` installed, do that first.
